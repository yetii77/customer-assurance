## Overview

RaptX is a cybersecurity research and development collective operating at the intersection of offensive security, automation, and capture the flag (CTF) engineering. We build tools, discover vulnerabilities, and create technically rigorous CTF challenges to push the boundaries of real-world infosec.

---

## Core Activities

- **CTF Competition**  
  Regular participation in national and international competitions (HackTheBox, CTFtime, DEF CON qualifiers).

- **Tool Development**  
  We engineer lightweight, battle-tested tools focused on recon, automation, binary analysis, and exploit development.

- **Vulnerability Research**  
  Responsible CVE discovery across web, cloud, and compiled applications. Full write-ups and patch coordination.

- **Challenge Design**  
  Internal and public challenge creation across categories: pwn, reverse, crypto, web, and forensics.
